# IMY-772-Calculator
## Goal
A very simple calculator app for an individual workshop assignment for my honours module, IMY 772, to demonstrate application of test-driven development processes and git workflow.  

The calculator app should be able to perform basic arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) on a set of hexadecimal numbers. The restrictions for the calculator is that it will only take inputs of up to 3 digits, return answers up to 6 digits, not return any negative answers, and not return any answers with decimal places.
